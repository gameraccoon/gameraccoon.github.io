# Non-gaming projects

Among games I like to develop some niche tools and small services in my free time. These projects usually start from me missing such a tool or service, and sometimes they grow into things that others may find useful.

## Apps/Tools

[scripter](https://github.com/gameraccoon/scripter) - a simple tool aimed towards developers who make scripts to automate daily routines (e.g. build scripts, local deployment, running tests, and etc.). The tool allows to have one front-end for running those scripts and chaining them together, showing progress, execution time, making presets, and more.

Written in Rust.

[easy-photo-backup](https://github.com/gameraccoon/easy-photo-backup) - an in-development project for simple and secure photo and video backup over Wi-Fi.

Written in Rust and Kotlin.

[binomial-calculator](https://github.com/gameraccoon/binomial-calculator) - a set of Python tools to calculate, plot, and analyse binomial probabilities.

## Web/Telegram

[1ts.dev](https://1ts.dev) - a tiny service for sending self-destructing messages. Usefult for sharing one-time secrets.

Written in Go.

[Spy Game Bot](https://spy-game.gameraccoon.com) - a small Telegram bot for playing a couple of hidden identity games with a party of friends offline. Only one player needs a Telegram account to play.

Written in Go.

[The King Says Bot](https://king.gameraccoon.com) - a small Telegram bot for playing a variation on truth-or-dare or ōsama with a party of friends offline. Only one player needs a Telegram account to play.

Written in Go.

[Riichi Trainer Bot](https://t.me/riichi_trainer_bot) - a Telegram bot for practicing tile efficiency for riichi mahjong.

Written in Rust.

[Riichi Scoring Trainer Bot](https://t.me/RiichiScoringTrainerBot) - a tiny bot for practicing score calculation for riichi mahjong.

Written in Rust.

[Random Shuffle Bot](https://t.me/RandomShuffleBot) - a small bot for randomizing lists and doing drafts.

Written in Go, only Russian is supported at the moment.

## Libraries

[RaccoonECS](https://github.com/gameraccoon/easy-photo-backup) - a simple ECS that I use in my gaming projects.

Written in C++17.

[sparse_set_container](https://crates.io/crates/sparse_set_container) - a Rust crate with a fast Vec-like container using keys that don't invalidate on insertion/removal, it is as fast to iterate over as Vec and has O(1) lookup and insertion complexity. See comparison to other similar crates: [benchmarks](https://github.com/gameraccoon/sparse_set_container?tab=readme-ov-file#benchmarks).

[reservoir-sampler](https://github.com/gameraccoon/reservoir-sampler) - a tiny C++ library containing a few classes to do reservoir sampling, aimed to make the randomized sampling from big streams of data as efficient as possible.
