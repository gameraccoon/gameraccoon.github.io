{{< project_preview name="D1FF" preview_image="d1ff-screenshot.png" years="(2013)" badge="-hobby_project-lightgray?" >}}

A 2D puzzle game where the player has to break into electronic locks by manipulating the values of bits in the memory of the lock device. The player can modify values of bits by applying the bitwise logical operations And, Or, and Xor to memory locations.

The game has two game modes: a chain of pre-packaged levels and hacking a random lock. There is also presented an interactive tutorial explaining the gameplay mechanics through a chain of levels. 

You could use one of two display modes: Classic, where the player would manipulate numeric values, and modern where the player manipulates the colored blocks and the value of the bits is determined by the brightness of these blocks.
Includes a level editor.

The game was developed in C++ and had a limited version ported to Java.

{{< project_preview name="Labels vs Radicals" preview_image="labels-vs-radicals-screenshot.jpg" years="(2010)" badge="-hobby_project-lightgray?" >}}

My first finished game. Developed as part of a university project called “Game Pack for Delphi”. I've also participated in the development of another two games from this package.

In this game, you have to run away from aggressive squares, firing them with a semi-automatic gun and planting bombs. The hero has a stock of magazines for his gun with 30 rounds of ammunition each, as well as a few bombs. You can force-reload, and all ammo in abandoned magazines will be lost. To gain better scores you need to survive as long as possible.

If a square was not killed for a long time it starts to get more aggressive and moves faster. There are several levels of difficulty which affect the speed of the enemies and the damage caused by them.
